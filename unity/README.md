## Unity interpreter

This project comes with an example scene (and code). The example is meant to run on desktop platforms only.

If you wish to use the Unity interpreter, you only need to copy the `Assets -> Scripts -> Open Day Dialogue` folder/directory.

Read the wiki for information on how to set this up for your Unity project.
