## GameMaker Studio 2 interpreter

If you wish to use the GMS2 interpreter, you only need to copy the `Open Day Dialogue` folders/directories into your project(s).
The rest is example code.

(If you wish to use this on GM:S 1.4, it *is* possible. You will need to update two scripts in `Scripts -> Open Day Dialogue -> Internal -> Not compatible with 1.4` to work. In one, change `instance_create_depth` to `instance_create`, and in the other, move the `#macro` statements into the project settings.)

## Example project

This project comes with an example scene (and code). The example is meant to run on desktop platforms only.

The example binary file, `Included Files -> example.opdac`, is generated from the following code:
```
namespace example:
    definitions menu:
        label.control_spacebar="Press spacebar to advance dialogue and select choices."
        label.control_arrows="Use left and right arrow keys to navigate choices."
    scene test:
        TestPerson: "Hello, world!"
        AnotherPerson: "It seems that it works?"
        TestPerson: "Yay!"
        
        // Label for jumping back to later
        example_test_hmm:
        
        Player: "Hmmm..."
        choice:
            "So, like, how does this work?":
                TestPerson: "This dialogue is compiled bytecode!"
                Player: "Whoa."
                AnotherPerson: "Someone used the Open Day Dialogue compiler to generate it."
                Player: "Huh."
            "Can we just end this scene?":
                TestPerson: "Of course!"
                exit
            "Can we jump to me talking for the first time?":
                TestPerson: "Yeah!"
                : example_test_hmm
            "Anything cool we can do here?":
                TestPerson: "Yeah."
                 "We can make the background change colors!"
                 "Okay, so here goes. I'll change it to red."
                bg red
                Player: "Wow."
                 "Cool."
                TestPerson: "I'll change it to grey now."
                bg grey
                Player: "Nice."
                AnotherPerson: "Enough of this nonsense!"
                 "Back to the original color."
                bg black
        Player: "So."
         "Is that it?"
        TestPerson: "I guess so."
         "See you around!"
        AnotherPerson: "Seeya!"
```
