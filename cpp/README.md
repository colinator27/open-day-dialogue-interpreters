## C++/C (and other languages with C library access) interpreter

**WARNING: INCOMPLETE, NOT READY FOR USE.**

Note: This interpreter is not for a specific engine. First of all, it is written in C++, and compiles into a DLL or static library. It has header files that can be used with C/C++, but any system/language/tool that can load C libraries should be able to use this interpreter.

So, to use, you must build the library. You may have to do some work if you want to compile on certain platforms, as this uses Visual Studio (2017).
