## C# interpreter

Note: This interpreter is for a *language* in general, not a specific engine.

To use the C# interpreter, either copy the `*.cs` files into your project or build the project as a library, which can then be referenced by its (DLL) file in another project.

This interpreter is almost identical to the Unity interpreter, and the [wiki](https://github.com/colinator27/open-day-dialogue-interpreters/wiki/Setting-up-for-your-Unity-project#basic-classes) explains some of the classes.
